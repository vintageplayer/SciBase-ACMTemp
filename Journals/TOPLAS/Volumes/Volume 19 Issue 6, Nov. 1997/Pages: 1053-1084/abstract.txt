Although code transformations are routinely applied to improve the performance of programs for both scalar and parallel machines, the properties of code-improving transformations are not well understood. In this article we present a framework that enables the exploration, both analytically and experimentally, of properties of code-improving transformations. The major component of the framework is a specification language, Gospel, for expressing the conditions needed to safely apply a transformation and the actions required to change the code to implement the transformation. The framework includes a technique that facilitates an analytical investigation of code-improving transformations using the Gospel specifications. It also contains a tool, Genesis, that automatically produces a  transformer that implements the transformations specified in Gospel. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by exploring the enabling and disabling properties of transformations. We first present analytical results on the enabling and disabling properties of a set of code transformations, including both traditional and parallelizing transformations, and then describe experimental results showing the types of transformations and the enabling and disabling interactions actually found in a set of programs.
