Fairness is a mathematical abstraction: in a multiprogramming environment, fairness abstracts the details of admissible (“fair”) schedulers; in a distributed environment, fairness abstracts the relative speeds of processors. We argue that the standard definition of fairness often is unnecessarily weak and can be replaced by the stronger, yet still abstract, notion of finitary fairness. While standard weak fairness requires that no enabled transition is postponed forever, finitary weak fairness requires that for every computation of a system there is an unknown boundksuch that no enabled transition is postponed more thankconsecutive times. In general, thefinitary restriction fin(F) of any given fairness  requirementFis the union of all &ohgr;-regular safety properties contained inF. The adequacy of the proposed abstraction is shown in two ways. Suppose we prove a program property under the assumption of finitary fairness. In a multiprogramming environment, the program then satisfies the property for all fair finite-state schedulers. In a distributed environment, the program then satisfies the property for all choices of lower and upper bounds on the speeds (or timings) of processors. The benefits of finitary fairness are twofold. First, the proof rules for verifying liveness properties of concurrent programs are simplified: well-founded induction over the natural numbers is adequate to prove termination under finitary fairness. Second, the fundamental  problem of consensus in a faulty asynchronous distributed environment can be solved assuming finitary fairness.
