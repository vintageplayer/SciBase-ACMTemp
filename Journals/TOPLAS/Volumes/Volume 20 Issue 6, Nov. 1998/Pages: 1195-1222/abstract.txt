In this article we investigate the trade-off between time and space efficiency in scheduling and executing parallel irregular computations on distributed-memory machines. We employ acyclic task dependence graphs to model irregular parallelism with mixed granularity, and we use direct remote memory access to support fast communication. We propose new scheduling techniques and a run-time active memory management scheme to improve memory utilization while retaining good time efficiency, and we provide a theoretical analysis on correctness and performance. This work is implemented in the context of the RAPID system which uses an inspector/executor approach to parallelize irregular computations at run-ti me. We demostrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on several irregular applications such as sparse matrix code and the fast multipole method for particle simulation. Our  experimental results on Cray-T3E show that problems large sizes can be solved under limited space capacity, and that the loss of execution efficiency caused by the extra memory management overhead is reasonable.
