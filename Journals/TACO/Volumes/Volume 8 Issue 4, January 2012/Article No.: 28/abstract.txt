Extracting high memory-level parallelism (MLP) is essential for speeding up single-threaded applications which are memory bound. At the same time, the projected amount of dark silicon (the fraction of the chip powered off) on a chip is growing. Hence, Asymmetric Multicore Processors (AMP) offer a unique opportunity to integrate many types of cores, each powered at different times, in order to optimize for different regions of execution. In this work, we quantify the potential for exploiting core customization to speedup programs during regions of high MLP. Based on a careful design space exploration, we discover that an AMP that includes a narrow and fast specialized core has the potential to efficiently exploit MLP.Using the results of our analysis, we design an AMP with both an MLP and ILP specialized core, and we propose a hardware-level, application steering mechanism called Symbiotic Core Execution (SCE). SCE detects MLP phases by monitoring the L2 miss rate of the application, and it uses that information to steer the application to the best core. Interestingly, we show that L2 miss rates are important for deciding when an MLP region begins and when it ends. As a program runs, its execution migrates to a core customized for MLP during regions of high MLP; when the region ends, it is re-scheduled on the core that fits the application characteristics.Compared to a monolithic core optimized for both modes of operation, our AMP design provides a harmonic mean performance improvement of 5.3&percnt; and 6.6&percnt; for SPEC2000 and SPEC2006, respectively, with a maximum speedup of 14.5&percnt;. For the same study, it achieves a 18.3&percnt; and 21.1&percnt; energy delay2reduction for SPEC2000 and SPEC2006, respectively. Our findings yield an important message for designing AMPs with specialized cores: core customization enables efficient exploitation of MLP, and application steering mechanisms for MLP are simple to implement and effective.
