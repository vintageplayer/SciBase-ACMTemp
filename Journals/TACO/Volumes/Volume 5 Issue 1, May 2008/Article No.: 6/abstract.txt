The wider acceptance of FPGAs as a computing device requires a higher level of programming abstraction. ROCCC is an optimizing C to HDL compiler. We describe the code generation approach in ROCCC. The smart buffer is a component that reuses input data between adjacent iterations. It significantly improves the performance of the circuit and simplifies loop control. The ROCCC-generated datapath can execute one loop iteration per clock cycle when there is no loop dependency or there is only scalar recurrence variable dependency. ROCCC's approach to supporting while-loops operating on scalars makes the compiler able to move scalar iterative computation into hardware.
