We survey recent developments in high level synthesis technology for VLSI design. The need for higher-level design automation tools are discussed first. We then describe some basic techniques for various subtasks of high-level synthesis. Techniques that have been proposed in the past few years (since 1994) for various subtasks of high-level synthesis are surveyed. We also survey some new synthesis objectives including testability, power efficiency, and reliability.
