A design verification methodology for microprocessor hardware based on  modeling design errors and generating simulation vectors for the modeled errors via physical fault testing techniques is presented. We have systematically collected design error data from a number of microprocessor design projects. The error data is used to derive error models suitable for design verification testing. A class of basic error models is identified and shown to yield tests that provide good coverage of common error types. To improve coverage for more complex errors, a new class of conditional error models is introduced. An experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology is presented. Single actual design errors are injected into a correct design, and it is determined if the methodology  will generate a test that detects the actual errors. The experiment has been conducted for two microprocessor designs and the results indicate that very high coverage of actual design errors can be obtained with test sets that are complete for a small number of synthetic error models.
