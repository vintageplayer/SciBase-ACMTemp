Constraint networks are a simple representation and reasoning framework with diverse applications. In this paper, we identify two new complementary properties on the restrictiveness of the constraints in a network—constraint tightnessandconstraint looseness—and we show their usefulness for estimating the level of local consistency needed to ensure global consistency, and for estimating the level of local consistency present in a network. In particular, we present a sufficient condition, based on constraint tightness and the level of local consistency, that guarantees that a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. The condition can be useful in applications where a knowledge base will be queried over and over and the  preprocessing costs can be amortized over many queries. We also present a sufficient condition for local consistency, based on constraint looseness, that is straightforward and inexpensive to determine. The condition can be used to estimate the level of local consistency of a network. This in turn can be used in deciding whether it would be useful to preprocess the network before a backtracking search, and in deciding which local consistency conditions, if any, still need to be enforced if we want to ensure that a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. Two definitions of local consistency are employed in characterizing the conditions: the traditional variable-based notion and a recently introduced definition of local consistency calledrelational  consistency.
