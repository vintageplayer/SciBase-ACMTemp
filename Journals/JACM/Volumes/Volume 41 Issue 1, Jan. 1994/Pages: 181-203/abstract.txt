We introduce a temporal logic for the specification of real-time systems. Our logic, TPTL, employs a novel quantifier construct for referencing time: thefreeze quantifierbinds a variable to the time of the local temporal context.TPTL is both a natural language for specification and a suitable formalism for verification. We present a tableau-based decision procedure and a model-checking algorithm for TPTL. Several generalizations of TPTL are shown to be highly undecidable.
