The rules governing the availability and quality of connections in a wireless network are described byphysicalmodels such as thesignal-to-interference & noise ratio (SINR)model. For a collection of simultaneously transmitting stations in the plane, it is possible to identify areception zonefor each station, consisting of the points where its transmission is received correctly. The resultingSINR diagrampartitions the plane into a reception zone per station and the remaining plane where no station can be heard.SINR diagrams appear to be fundamental to understanding the behavior of wireless networks, and may play a key role in the development of suitable algorithms for such networks, analogous perhaps to the role played by Voronoi diagrams in the study of proximity queries and related issues in computational geometry. So far, however, the properties of SINR diagrams have not been studied systematically, and most algorithmic studies in wireless networking rely on simplifiedgraph-basedmodels such as theunit disk graph (UDG)model, which conveniently abstract away interference-related complications, and make it easier to handle algorithmic issues, but consequently fail to capture accurately some important aspects of wireless networks.This article focuses on obtaining some basic understanding of SINR diagrams, their properties and their usability in algorithmic applications. Specifically, we have shown that assuming uniform power transmissions, the reception zones are convex and relatively well-rounded. These results are then used to develop an efficient approximation algorithm for a fundamental point location problem in wireless networks.
