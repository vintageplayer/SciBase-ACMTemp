In this paper, we develop a framework for computing upper and lower bounds of an exponential form for a large class of single resource systems with Markov additive inputs. Specifically, the bounds are on quantities such as backlog, queue length, and response time. Explicit or computable expressions for our bounds are given in the context of queuing theory and numerical comparisons with other bounds and exact results are presented. The paper concludes with two applications to admission control in multimedia systems.
