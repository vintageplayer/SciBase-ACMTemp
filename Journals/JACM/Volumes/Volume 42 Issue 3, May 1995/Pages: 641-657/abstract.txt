Consider a switching component in a packet-switching network, where messages from several incoming channels arrive and are routed to appropriate outgoing ports according to a service policy. One requirement in the design of such a system is to determine the buffer storage necessary at the input of each channel and the policy for serving these buffers that will prevent buffer overflow and the corresponding loss of messages. In this paper, a class of buffer service policies, called Least Time to Reach Bound (LTRB), is introduced that guarantees no overflow, and for which the buffer size required at each input channel is independent of the number of channels and their relative speeds. Further, the storage requirement is only twice the maximal length of a message in all cases, and as a consequence the class is shown to beoptimalin the sense that any nonoverflowing policy requires at least as much storage as LTRB.
