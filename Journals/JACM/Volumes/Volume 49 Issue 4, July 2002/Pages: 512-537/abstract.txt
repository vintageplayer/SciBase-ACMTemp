This paper argues that for many algorithms, and static analysis algorithms in particular, bottom-up logic program presentations are clearer and simpler to analyze, for both correctness andcomplexity, than classical pseudo-code presentations. The main technical contribution consists of two theorems which allow, in many cases, the asymptotic running time of a bottom-up logic program to be determined by inspection. It is well known that a datalog program runs inO(nk) time wherekis the largest number of free variables in any single rule. The theorems given here are significantly more refined. A variety of algorithms are presented and analyzed as examples.
