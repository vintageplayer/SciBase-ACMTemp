We show how to use an interactive theorem prover, HOL, together with a model checker, SPIN, to prove key properties of distance vector routing protocols. We do three case studies: correctness of the RIP standard, a sharp real-time bound on RIP stability, and preservation of loop-freedom in AODV, a distance vector protocol for wireless networks. We develop verification techniques suited to routing protocols generally. These case studies show significant benefits from automated support in reduced verification workload and assistance in finding new insights and gaps for standard specifications.
