Motivated by a recent conjecture concerning the expressiveness of declarative networking, we propose a formal computation model for “eventually consistent” distributed querying, based on relational transducers. A tight link has been conjectured between coordination-freeness of computations, and monotonicity of the queries expressed by such computations. Indeed, we propose a formal definition of coordination-freeness and confirm that the class of monotone queries is captured by coordination-free transducer networks. Coordination-freeness is a semantic property, but the syntactic class of “oblivious” transducers we define also captures the same class of monotone queries. Transducer networks that are not coordination-free are much more powerful.
