We consider the distributed source coding problem in which correlated data picked up by scattered sensors has to be encoded separately and transmitted to a common receiver, subject to a rate-distortion constraint. Although near-to-optimal solutions based on Turbo and LDPC codes exist for this problem, in most cases the proposed techniques do not scale to networks of hundreds of sensors. We present a scalable solution based on the following key elements: (a) distortion-optimized index assignments for low-complexity distributed quantization, (b) source-optimized hierarchical clustering based on the Kullback-Leibler distance and (c) sum-product decoding on specific factor graphs exploiting the correlation of the data.
