A connectivity-based and anchor-free three-dimensional localization (CATL) scheme is presented for large-scale sensor networks with concave regions. It distinguishes itself from previous work with a combination of three features: (1) it works for networks in both 2D and 3D spaces, possibly containing holes or concave regions; (2) it is anchor-free and uses only connectivity information to faithfully recover the original network topology, up to scaling and rotation; (3) it does not depend on the knowledge of network boundaries, which suits it well to situations where boundaries are difficult to identify. The key idea of CATL is to discover thenotch nodes, where shortest paths bend and hop-count-based distance starts to significantly deviate from the true Euclidean distance. An iterative protocol is developed that uses anotch-avoidingmultilateration mechanism to localize the network. Simulations show that CATL achieves accurate localization results with a moderate per-node message cost.
