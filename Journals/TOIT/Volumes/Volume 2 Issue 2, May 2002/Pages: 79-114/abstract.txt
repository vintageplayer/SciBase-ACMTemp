We present the results of the <bigwig> project, which aims
to design and implement a high-level domain-specific language for
programming interactive Web services.A fundamental aspect of the development of the World Wide Web
during the last decade is the gradual change from static to dynamic
generation of Web pages. Generating Web pages dynamically in dialog
with the client has the advantage of providing up-to-date and
tailor-made information. The development of systems for
constructing such dynamic Web services has emerged as a whole new
research area.The <bigwig> language is designed by analyzing its
application domain and identifying fundamental aspects of Web
services inspired by problems and solutions in existing Web service
development languages. The core of the design consists of a
session-centered service model together with a flexible
template-based mechanism for dynamic Web page construction. Using
specialized program analyses, certain Web-specific properties are
verified at compile time, for instance that only valid HTML 4.01 is
ever shown to the clients. In addition, the design provides
high-level solutions to form field validation, caching of dynamic
pages, and temporal-logic based concurrency control, and it
proposes syntax macros for making highly domain-specific
languages.The language is implemented via widely available Web
technologies, such as Apache on the server-side and JavaScript and
Java Applets on the client-side. We conclude with experience and
evaluation of the project.
