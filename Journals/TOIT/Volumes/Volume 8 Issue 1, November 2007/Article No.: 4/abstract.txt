Web services composition is a keystone in the development of interoperable systems. However, despite the widespread adoption of Web services, several obstacles still hinder their smooth automatic semantic reconciliation when being composed. Consistent understanding of data exchanged between composed Web services is hampered by various implicit modeling assumptions and representations. Our contribution in this article revolves around context and how it enriches data exchange between Web services. In particular, a context-based mediation approach to solve semantic heterogeneities between composed Web services is presented.
