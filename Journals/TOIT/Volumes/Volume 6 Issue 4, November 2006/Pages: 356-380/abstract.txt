The widespread diffusion of mobile computing calls for novel services capable of providing results that depend on both the current physical position of users (location) and the logical set of accessible resources, subscribed services, preferences, and requirements (context). Leaving the burden of location/context management to applications complicates service design and development. In addition, traditional middleware solutions tend to hide location/context visibility to the application level and are not suitable for supporting novel adaptive services for mobile computing scenarios. The article proposes a flexible middleware for the development and deployment of location/context-aware services for heterogeneous data access in the Internet. A primary design choice is to exploit a high-level policy framework to simplify the specification of services that the middleware dynamically adapts to the client location/context. In addition, the middleware adopts the mobile agent technology to effectively support autonomous, asynchronous, and local access to data resources, and is particularly suitable for temporarily disconnected clients. The article also presents the case study of a museum guide assistant service that provides visitors with location/context-dependent artistic data. The case study points out the flexibility and usability of the proposed middleware that permits automatic service reconfiguration with no impact on the implementation of the application logic.
