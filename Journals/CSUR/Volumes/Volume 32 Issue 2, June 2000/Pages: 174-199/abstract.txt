The expanding gap between microprocessor and DRAM performance has 
necessitated the use of increasingly aggressive techniques designed to reduce or hide the latency of main memory access. Although large cache hierarchies have proven to be effective in reducing this latency for the most frequently used data, it is still not uncommon for many programs to spend more than half their run times stalled on memory requests. Data prefetching has been proposed as a technique for hiding the access latency of data referencing patterns that defeat caching strategies. Rather than waiting for a cache miss to initiate a memory fetch, data prefetching anticipates such misses and issues a fetch to the memory system in advance of the actual memory reference. To be effective, prefetching must be  implemented in such a way that prefetches are timely, useful, and introduce little overhead. Secondary effects such as cache pollution and increased memory bandwidth requirements must also be taken into consideration. Despite these obstacles, prefetching has the potential to significantly improve overall program execution time by overlapping computation with memory accesses. Prefetching strategies are diverse, and no single strategy has yet been proposed that provides optimal performance. The following survey examines several alternative approaches, and discusses the design tradeoffs involved when implementing a data prefetch strategy.
