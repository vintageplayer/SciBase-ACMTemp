Materialized aggregate views represent a set of redundant entities in a data warehouse that are frequently used to accelerate On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). Due to the complex structure of the data warehouse and the different profiles of the users who submit queries, there is need for tools that will automate and ease the view selection and management processes. In this article we present DynaMat, a system that manages dynamic collections of materialized aggregate views in a data warehouse. At query time, DynaMat utilizes a dedicated disk space for storing computed aggregates that are further engaged for answering new queries. Queries are executed independently or can be bundled within a multiquery expression. In the latter case, we present an execution mechanism that exploits dependencies among the queries and the materialized set to further optimize their execution. During updates, DynaMat reconciles the current materialized view selection and refreshes the most beneficial subset of it within a given maintenance window. We show how to derive an efficient update plan with respect to the available maintenance window, the different update policies for the views and the dependencies that exist among them.
