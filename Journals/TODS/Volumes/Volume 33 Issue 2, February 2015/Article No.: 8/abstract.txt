The standard approach for term frequency normalization is based only on the document length. However, it does not distinguish the verbosity from the scope, these being the two main factors determining the document length. Because the verbosity and scope have largely different effects on the increase in term frequency, the standard approach can easily suffer from insufficient or excessive penalization depending on the specific type of long document. To overcome these problems, this article proposes two-stage normalization by performing verbosity and scope normalization separately, and by employing different penalization functions. In verbosity normalization, each document is prenormalized by dividing the term frequency by the verbosity of the document. In scope normalization, an existing retrieval model is applied in a straightforward manner to the prenormalized document, finally leading us to formulate our proposed verbosity normalized (VN) retrieval model. Experimental results carried out on standard TREC collections demonstrate that the VN model leads to marginal but statistically significant improvements over standard retrieval models.
