There are numerous problems associated with formulating queries on 
networked information systems. These include increased data volume and complexity, accompanied by slow network access. This article proposes a new approach to a network query user interfaces that consists of two phases: query preview and query refinement. This new approach is based on the concepts of dynamic queries and query previews, which guides users in rapidly and dynamically eliminating undesired records, reducing the data volume to a manageable size, and refining queries locally before submission over a network. Examples of two applications are given: a Restaurant Finder and a prototype for NASA's Earth Observing Systems Data Information Systems (EOSDIS). Data architecture is discussed, and user feedback is  presented.
