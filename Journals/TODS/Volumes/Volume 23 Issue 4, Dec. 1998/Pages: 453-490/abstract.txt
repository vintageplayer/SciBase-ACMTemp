Two well-known indexing methods are inverted files and signature files. We have undertaken a detailed comparison of these two approaches in the context of text indexing, paying particular attention to query evaluation speed and space requirements. We have examined their relative performance using both experimentation and a refined approach to modeling of signature files, and demonstrate that inverted files are distinctly superior to signature files. Not only can inverted files be used to evaluate typical queries in less time than can signature files, but inverted files require less space and provide greater functionality. Our results also show that a synthetic text database can provide a realistic indication of the behavior of an actual text database. The tools used to generate the  synthetic database have been made publicly available
