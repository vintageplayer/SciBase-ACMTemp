Three recent trends in database research are object-oriented and deductive databases and graph-based user interfaces. We draw these trends together in a data model we call the Hypernode Model. The single data structure of this model is thehypernode, a graph whose nodes can themselves be graphs. Hypernodes are typed, and types, too, are nested graphs. We give the theoretical foundations of hypernodes and types, and we show that type checking is tractable. We show also how conventional type-forming operators can be simulated by our graph types, including cyclic types. The Hypernode Model comes equipped with a rule-based query language called Hyperlog, which is complete with respect to computation and update. We define the operational semantics of Hyperlog and show  that the evaluation can be performed efficiently. We discuss also the use of Hyperlog for supporting database browsing, an essential feature of Hypertext databases. We compare our work with other graph-based data models—unlike previous graph-based models, the Hypernode Model provides inherent support for data abstraction via its nesting of graphs. Finally, we briefly discuss the implementation of a DBMS based on the Hypernode Model.
