Modeling and verifying complex real-time systems are challenging research problems. Thede factoapproach is based on Timed Automata, which are finite state automata equipped with clock variables. Timed Automata are deficient in modeling hierarchical complex systems. In this work, we propose a language calledStateful Timed CSPand an automated approach for verifying Stateful Timed CSP models. Stateful Timed CSP is based on Timed CSP and is capable of specifying hierarchical real-time systems. Through dynamic zone abstraction,finite-statezone graphs can be generated automatically from Stateful Timed CSP models, which are subject to model checking. Like Timed Automata, Stateful Timed CSP models suffer from Zeno runs, that is, system runs that take infinitely many steps within finite time. Unlike Timed Automata, model checking with non-Zenoness in Stateful Timed CSP can be achieved based on the zone graphs. We extend the PAT model checker to support system modeling and verification using Stateful Timed CSP and show its usability/scalability via verification of real-world systems.
