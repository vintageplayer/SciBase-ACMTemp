When using object-oriented frameworks it is easy to overlook certain important method calls that are required at particular places in code. In this article, we provide a comprehensive set of empirical facts on this problem, starting from traces of missing method calls in a bug repository. We propose a new system that searches for missing method calls in software based on the other method calls that are observable. Our key insight is that the voting theory concept of majority rule holds for method calls: a call is likely to be missing if there is a majority of similar pieces of code where this call is present. The evaluation shows that the system predictions go further missing method calls and often reveal different kinds of code smells (e.g., violations of API best practices).
