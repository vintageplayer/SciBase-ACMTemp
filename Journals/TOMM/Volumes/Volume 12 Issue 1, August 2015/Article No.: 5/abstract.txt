Zoomable video streaming refers to a new class of interactive video applications, where users can zoom into a video stream to view a selected region of interest in higher resolutions and pan around to move the region of interest. The zoom and pan effects are typically achieved by breaking the source video into a grid of independently decodable tiles. Streaming the tiles to a set of heterogeneous users using broadcast is challenging, as users have different link rates and different regions of interest at different resolution levels. In this article, we consider the following problem: Given the subset of tiles that each user requested, the link rate of each user, and the available time slots, at which resolution should each tile be sent, to maximize the overall video quality received by all users. We design an efficient algorithm to solve this problem and evaluate the solution on a testbed using 10 mobile devices. Our method is able to achieve up to 12dB improvements over other heuristic methods.
