The Continuous Media File System, CMFS, supports real-time storage and retrieval of continuous media data (digital audio and video) on disk. CMFS clients read or write files in “sessions,” each with a guaranteed minimum data rate. Multiple sessions, perhaps with different rates, and non-real-time access can proceed concurrently. CMFS addresses several interrelated design issues; real-time semantics fo sessions, disk layout, an acceptance test for new sessions, and disk scheduling policy. We use simulation to compare different design choices.
