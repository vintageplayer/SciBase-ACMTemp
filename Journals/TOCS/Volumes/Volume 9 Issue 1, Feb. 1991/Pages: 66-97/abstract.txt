The use of registers in a processor reduces the data and instruction memory traffic. Since this reduction is a significant factor in the improvement of the program execution time, recent VLSI processors have a large number of registers which can be used efficiently because of the advances in compiler technology. However, since registers have to be saved/restored across function calls, the corresponding register saving and restoring (RSR) memory traffic can almost eliminate the overall reduction. This traffic has been reduced by compiler optimizations and by providing multiple-window register files. Although these multiple-window architectures produce a large reduction in the RSR traffic, they have several drawbacks which make the single-window file preferable. We consider a   combination ofhardware supportandcompiler optimizationsto reduce the RSR traffic for a single-window register file, beyond the reductions achieved by compiler optimizations alone. Basically, this hardware keeps track of the registers that are written during execution, so that the number of registers saved is minimized.  Moreover, hardware is added so that a register is saved in the activation record of the function that uses it (instead of in the record of the current function); in this way a register is restored only when it is needed, rather than wholesale on procedure return. We present a register saving and restoring policy that makes use of this hardware, discuss its implementation, and evaluate the traffic reduction when the policy is combined   with intraprocedural and interprocedural compiler optimizations. We show that, on the average for the four general-purpose programs measured, the RSR traffic is reduced by about 90 percent for a small register file (i.e., 32 registers), which results in an overall data memory traffic reduction of about 15 percent.
