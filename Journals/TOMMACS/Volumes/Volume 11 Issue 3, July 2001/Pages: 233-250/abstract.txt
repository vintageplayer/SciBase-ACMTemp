We investigate individual packet delay in a model of data networks with table-free, partial table and full table routing. We present analytical estimation for the average packet delay in a network with small partial routing table. Dependence of the delay on the size of the network and on the size of the partial routing table is examined numerically. Consequences for network scalability are discussed.
