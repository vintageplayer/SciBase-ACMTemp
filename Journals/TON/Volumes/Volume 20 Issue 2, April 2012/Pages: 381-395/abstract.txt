In this paper, we consider the problem of blocking malicious traffic on the Internet via source-based filtering. In particular, we consider filtering via access control lists (ACLs): These are already available at the routers today, but are a scarce resource because they are stored in the expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). Aggregation (by filtering source prefixes instead of individual IP addresses) helps reduce the number of filters, but comes also at the cost of blocking legitimate traffic originating from the filtered prefixes. We show how to optimally choose which source prefixes to filter for a variety of realistic attack scenarios and operators' policies. In each scenario, we design optimal, yet computationally efficient, algorithms. Using logs from Dshield.org, we evaluate the algorithms and demonstrate that they bring significant benefit in practice.
