In wireless cellular networks or in other networks with single-hop communication, the fundamental access control problem pertains to access point (AP) selection and channel allocation for each user. For users in the coverage area of one AP, this involves only channel allocation. However, users that belong in the intersection of coverage areas of more than one AP can select the appropriate AP to establish connection and implicitly affect the channel assignment procedure. We address the joint problem of AP selection and channel assignment with the objective to satisfy a given user load vector with the minimum number of channels. Our major finding is that the joint problem reduces to plain channel allocation in a cellular network that emerges from the original one after executing an iterative and provably convergent clique load balancing algorithm. For linear cellular networks, our approach leads to minimum number of required channels to serve a given load vector. For 2-D cellular networks, the same approach leads to a heuristic algorithm with a suboptimal solution due to the fact that clique loads cannot be balanced. Numerical results demonstrate the performance benefits of our approach in terms of blocking probability in a dynamic scenario with time-varying number of connection requests. The presented approach constitutes the basis for addressing more composite resource allocation problems in different context.
