This study investigates the problem of fault management in a wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)-based optical mesh network in which failures occur due to fiber cuts. In reality, bundles of fibers often get cut at the same time due to construction or destructive natural events, such as earthquakes. Fibers laid down in the sameducthave a significant probability to fail at the same time. When path protection is employed, we require the primary path and the backup path to be duct-disjoint, so that the network is survivable under single-duct failures. Moreover, if two primary paths go through any common duct, their backup paths cannot share wavelengths on common links. This study addresses the routing and wavelength-assignment problem in a network with path protection under duct-layer constraints. Off-line algorithms for static traffic is developed to combat single-duct failures. The objective is to minimize total number of wavelengths used on all the links in the network. Both integer linear programs and a heuristic algorithm are presented and their performance is compared through numerical examples.
