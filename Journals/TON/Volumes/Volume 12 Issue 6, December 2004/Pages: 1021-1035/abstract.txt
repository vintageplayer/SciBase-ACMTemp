User mobility profile (UMP) is a combination of historic records and predictive patterns of mobile terminals, which serve as fundamental information for mobility management and enhancement of quality of service (QoS) in wireless multimedia networks. In this paper, a UMP framework is developed for estimating service patterns and tracking mobile users, including descriptions of location, mobility, and service requirements. For each mobile user, the service requirement is estimated using a mean-square error method. Moreover, a new mobility model is designed to characterize not only stochastic behaviors, but historical records and predictive future locations of mobile users as well. Therefore, our approach incorporates aggregate history and current system parameters to acquire UMP. In particular, an adaptive algorithm is designed to predict the future positions of mobile terminals in terms of location probabilities based on moving directions and residence time in a cell. Simulation results are shown to indicate that the proposed schemes are effective on mobility and resource management by evaluating blocking/dropping probabilities and location tracking costs in wireless networks.
