Savings in switching costs of an optical cross-connect can be achieved by grouping together a set of consecutive wavelengths and switching them as a single waveband. This technique is known as waveband switching. While previous work has focused on either uniform band sizes or nonuniform band sizes considering a single node, in this paper we focus on the number of wavebands and their sizes for ring topologies. First, we show that such solutions are inadequate when considering the entire network. We then present a novel framework for optimizing the number of wavebands in a ring network for deterministic traffic. The objective of the Band Minimization Problem is to minimize the number of nonuniform wavebands in the network while using the minimum possible number of wavelengths. We show that the problem is NP-hard and present heuristics for it. We then consider a specific type of traffic, namely all-to-all traffic, and present a construction method for achieving the minimum number of wavebands in the ring. Our results show that the number of ports can be reduced by a large amount using waveband switching compared to wavelength switching, for both all-to-all traffic and random traffic. We also numerically evaluate the performance of our waveband design algorithms under dynamic stochastic traffic.
