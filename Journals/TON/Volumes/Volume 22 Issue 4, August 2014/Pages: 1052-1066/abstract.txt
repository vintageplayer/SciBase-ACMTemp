We study the reliability maximization problem in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks with random link failures. Reliability in these networks is defined as the probability that the logical network is connected, and it is determined by the underlying lightpath routing, network topologies, and the link failure probability. By introducing the notion of lexicographical ordering for lightpath routings, we characterize precise optimization criteria for maximum reliability in the low failure probability regime. Based on the optimization criteria, we develop lightpath routing algorithms that maximize the reliability, and logical topology augmentation algorithms for further improving reliability. We also study the reliability maximization problem in the high failure probability regime.
