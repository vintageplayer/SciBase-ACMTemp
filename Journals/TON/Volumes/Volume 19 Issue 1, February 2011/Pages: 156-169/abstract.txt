We consider the sizing of network buffers in IEEE 802.11-based networks. Wireless networks face a number of fundamental issues that do not arise in wired networks. We demonstrate that the use of fixed-size buffers in 802.11 networks inevitably leads to either undesirable channel underutilization or unnecessary high delays. We present two novel dynamic buffer-sizing algorithms that achieve high throughput while maintaining low delay across a wide range of network conditions. Experimental measurements demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithms in a production WLAN and a lab test bed.
