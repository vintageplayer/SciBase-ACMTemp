This paper proposes FlashLinQ--a synchronous peer-to-peer wireless PHY/MAC network architecture. FlashLinQ leverages the fine-grained parallel channel access offered by OFDM and incorporates an analog energy-level-based signaling scheme that enables signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based distributed scheduling. This new signaling mechanism, and the concomitant scheduling algorithm, enables efficient channel-aware spatial resource allocation, leading to significant gains over a CSMA/CA system using RTS/CTS. FlashLinQ is a complete system architecture including: 1) timing and frequency synchronization derived from cellular spectrum; 2) peer discovery; 3) link management; and 4) channel-aware distributed power, data rate, and link scheduling. FlashLinQ has been implemented for operation over licensed spectrum on a digital signal processor/ field-programmable gate array (DSP/FPGA) platform. In this paper, we present FlashLinQ performance results derived from both measurements and simulations.
