The availability of cost-effective wireless network interface cards makes it practical to design network devices with multiple radios which can be exploited to simultane-ously transmit/receive over different frequency channels. It has been shown that using multiple radios per node increases the throughput of multi-hop wireless mesh networks. However, multi-radios create several research challenges. A fundamental problem is the joint channel assignment and routing problem, i.e., how the channels can be assigned to radios and how a set of flow rates can be determined for every network link in order to achieve an anticipated objective. This joint problem is NP-com-plete. Thus, an approximate solution is developed by solving the channel assignment and the routing problems separately. The channel assignment problem turns out to be the problem to assign channels such that a given set of flow rates are schedulable and itself is shown to be also NP-complete. This paper shows that not only the channels but also the transmission rates of the links have to be properly selected to make a given set of flow rates schedulable. Thus, a greedy heuristic for the channel and rate assignment problem is developed. Algorithms to schedule the resulting set of flow rates have been proposed in the literature, which require synchronization among nodes and hence modified coordination functions. Unlike previous work, in this paper a forwarding paradigm is developed to achieve the resulting set of flow rates while using a standard MAC. A bi-dimensional Markov chain model of the proposed forwarding paradigm is presented to analyze its behavior. Thorough performance studies are con-ducted to: a) compare the proposed greedy heuristic to other channel assignment algorithms; b) analyze the behavior of the forwarding paradigm through numerical simulations based on the Markov chain model; c) simulate the operations of the forwarding paradigm and evaluate the achieved network throughput.
