In MPLS/GMPLS networks, a range of restoration schemes will be required to support different tradeoffs between service interruption time and network resource utilization. In light of these tradeoffs, path-based end-to-end shared mesh restoration provides a very attractive solution. However, efficient use of bandwidth for shared mesh restoration strongly relies on the procedure for selecting restoration paths. In this paper, we propose an efficient restoration path selection algorithm for restorable connections over shared bandwidth in a fully distributed MPLS/GMPLS architecture. We also describe how to extend MPLS/GMPLS signaling protocols to collect the necessary information efficiently. To evaluate the algorithm's performance, we compare it via simulation with two other well-known algorithms on a typical intercity backbone network. The key figure of merit for restoration bandwidth efficiency isrestoration overbuild, i.e., the extra bandwidth required to meet the network restoration objective as a percentage of the bandwidth of the network with no restoration. Our simulation results show that our algorithm uses significantly less restoration overbuild (63%-68%) compared with the other two algorithms (83%-90%).
