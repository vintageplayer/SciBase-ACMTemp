Routing with service restorability is of much importance in Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) networks, and is a necessity in optical networks. For restoration, each connection has an active path and a link-disjoint backup path. The backup path enables service restoration upon active path failure. For bandwidth efficiency, backups may be shared. This requires that at least the aggregate backup bandwidth used on each link be distributed to nodes performing route computations. If this information is not available, sharing is not possible. Also, one scheme in use for restorability in optical networks is for the sender to transmit simultaneously on the two disjoint paths and for the receiver to choose data from the path with stronger signal. This has the advantage of fast receiver-initiated recovery upon failure but it does not allow backup sharing.In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient dynamic routing of restorable connections when backup sharing is not allowed. Our objective is to be able to route as many connections as possible for one-at-a-time arrivals and no knowledge of future arrivals. Since sharing cannot be used for achieving efficiency, the goal is to achieve efficiency by improved path selection. We show that by using the minimum-interference ideas used for nonrestorable routing, we can develop efficient algorithms that outperform previously proposed algorithms for restorable routing such as routing with the min-hop like objective of finding two disjoint paths with minimum total hop-count. We present two new and efficient algorithms for restorable routing without sharing, and one of them requires only shortest path computations. We demonstrate that both algorithms perform very well in comparison to previously proposed algorithms.
