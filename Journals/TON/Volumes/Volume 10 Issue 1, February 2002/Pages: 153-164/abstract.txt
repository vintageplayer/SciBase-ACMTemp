Current means of providing loop-back recovery, which is widely used in SONET, rely on ring topologies, or on overlaying logical ring topologies upon physical meshes. Loop-back is desirable to provide rapid preplanned recovery of link or node failures in a bandwidth-efficient distributed manner. We introduce generalized loop-back, a novel scheme for performing loop-back in optical mesh networks. We present an algorithm to perform recovery for link failure and one to perform generalized loop-back recovery for node failure. We illustrate the operation of both algorithms, prove their validity, and present a network management protocol algorithm, which enables distributed operation for link or node failure. We present three different applications of generalized loop-back. First, we present heuristic algorithms for selecting recovery graphs, which maintain short maximum and average lengths of recovery paths. Second, we present WDM-based loop-back recovery for optical networks where wavelengths are used to back up other wavelengths. We compare, for WDM-based loop-back, the operation of generalized loop-back operation with known ring-based ways of providing loop-back recovery over mesh networks. Finally, we introduce the use of generalized loop-back to provide recovery in a way that allows dynamic choice of routes over preplanned directions.
