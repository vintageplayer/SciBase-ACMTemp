Two planar triangulations with a correspondence between the pair of vertex sets are compatible (isomorphic) if they are topologically equivalent. This work describes methods for morphing compatible planar triangulations with identical convex boundaries in a manner that guarantees compatibility throughout the morph. These methods are based on a fundamental representation of a planar triangulation as a matrix that unambiguously describes the triangulation. Morphing the triangulations corresponds to interpolations between these matrices.We show that this basic approach can be extended to obtain better control over the morph, resulting in valid morphs with various natural properties. Two schemes, which generate the linear trajectory morph if it is valid, or a morph with trajectories close to linear otherwise, are presented. An efficient method for verification of validity of the linear trajectory morph between two triangulations is proposed. We also demonstrate how to obtain a morph with a natural evolution of triangle areas and how to find a smooth morph through a given intermediate triangulation.
