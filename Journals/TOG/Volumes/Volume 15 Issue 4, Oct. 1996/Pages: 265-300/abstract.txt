This article is concerned with creating more realistic images of 3D scenes which are moving relative to the viewer at such high speeds that the propagation delay of light signals and other relativistic effects can not be neglected. Creating images of 3D scenes in relativistic motion might have important applications to science-fiction films, computer games, and virtual environments. We shall discuss the following problems: (1) how to determine the visual appearance of a rapidly moving object, (2) how to determine the apparent radiance of a scene point on a moving object, (3) how to determine the incident irradiance at a scene point coming from a moving light source, (4) how to determine the color of a rapidly moving object, and (5) how to generate shadows when there are relative  motions between the viewer, the scenes, and the light sources. Detailed examples are also given to show the result of shading with the relativistic effects taken into account.
