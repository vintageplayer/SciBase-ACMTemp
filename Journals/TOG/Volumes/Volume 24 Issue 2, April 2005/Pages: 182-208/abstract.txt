In this article, we propose an error-resilient transmission method for progressively compressed 3D models. The proposed method is scalable with respect to both channel bandwidth and channel packet-loss rate. We jointly design source and channel coders using a statistical measure that (i) calculates the number of both source and channel coding bits, and (ii) distributes the channel coding bits among the transmitted refinement levels in order to maximize the expected decoded model quality. In order to keep the total number of bits before and after applying error protection the same, we transmit fewer triangles in the latter case to accommodate the channel coding bits. When the proposed method is used to transmit a typical model over a channel with a 10&percnt; packet-loss rate, the distortion (measured using theHausdorffdistance between the original and the decoded models) is reduced by 50&percnt; compared to the case when no error protection is applied.
