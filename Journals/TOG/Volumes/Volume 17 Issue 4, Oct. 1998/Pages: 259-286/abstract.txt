One of the major unsolved problems in parametric solid modeling is a robust update (regeneration) of the solid's boundary representation, given a specified change in the solid's parameter values. The fundamental difficulty lies in determining the mapping between boundary representations for solids in the same parametric family. Several heuristic approaches have been proposed for dealing with this problem, but the formal properties of such mappings are not well understood. We propose a formal definition for boundary representation. (BR-)deformation for solids in the same parametric family, based on the assumption of continuity: small changes in solid parameter values should result in small changes in the solid's boundary reprentation, which may include local collapses of cells in the  boundary representation. The necessary conditions that must be satisfied by any BR-deforming mappings between boundary representations are powerful enough to identify invalid updates in many (but not all) practical situations, and the algorithms to check them are simple. Our formulation provides a formal criterion for the recently proposed heuristic approaches to “persistent naming,” and explains the difficulties in devising sufficient tests for BR-deformation encountered in practice. Finally our methods are also applicable to more general cellular models of pointsets and should be useful in developing universal standards in parametric modeling.
