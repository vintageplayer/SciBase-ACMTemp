Recently, online social networks have emerged that allow people to share their multimedia files, retrieve interesting content, and discover like-minded people. These systems often provide the possibility to annotate the content with tags and ratings.Using a random walk through the social annotation graph, we have combined these annotations into a retrieval model that effectively balances the personal preferences and opinions of like-minded users into a single relevance ranking for either content, tags, or people. We use this model to identify the influence of different annotation methods and system design aspects on common ranking tasks in social content systems.Our results show that a combination of rating and tagging information can improve tasks like search and recommendation. The optimal influence of both sources on the ranking is highly dependent on the retrieval task and system design. Results on content search and tag suggestion indicate that the profile created by a user's annotations can be used effectively to adapt the ranking to personal preferences. The random walk reduces sparsity problems by smoothly integrating indirectly related concepts in the relevance ranking, which is especially valuable for cold-start users or individual tagging systems like YouTube and Flickr.
