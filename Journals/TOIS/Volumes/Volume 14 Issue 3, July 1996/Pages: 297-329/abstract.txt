In information systems engineering, conceptual models are constructed to assess existing information systems and work out requirements for new ones. As these models serve as a means for communication between customers and developers, it is paramount that both parties understand the models, as well as that the models form a proper basis for the subsequent design and implementation of the systems. New CASE environments are now experimenting with formal modeling languages and various techniques for validating conceptual models, though it seems difficult to come up with a technique that handles the linguistic barriers between the parties involved in a satisfactory manner. In this article, we discuss the theoretical basis of an explanation component implemented for the PPP CASE environment. This component integrates other validation techniques and provides a very flexible natural-language interface to complex model information. It describes properties of the modeling language and the conceptual models in terms familiar to users, and the explanations can be combined with graphical model views. When models are executed, it can justify requested inputs and explain computed outputs by relating trace information to properties of the models.
